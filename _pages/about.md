</figure>
- **Research Goal:** Investigated smartphone users’ momentary attention states through multimodal sensing and behavioral modeling.  
- **Framework & Data Collection:** Designed an end-to-end attention prediction framework and developed an Android app to log device interactions, sensor data, and ESM self-reports. Conducted field studies with 43 participants, collecting 9K+ real-world samples ([Dataset Released](https://github.com/linlinlinlinlinkele/AttenTrack)).  
- **Analysis & Modeling:** Applied mixed-methods analysis combining LLM-assisted thematic coding and statistical modeling; achieved 80%+ F1 in cold-start attention state prediction.

  </figcaption> -->
</figure>
- **Research Goal:** Designed a trajectory planning framework based on convex sets.  
- **Methodology:** Partitioned the robot arm’s free space into multiple convex regions and constructed a weighted graph based on the reachability between regions. Performed graph search to generate a sequence of convex regions and optimized trajectories within each region.  
- **Key Design:** (1) Efficiently generated convex regions using goal-directed sampling. (2) Reduced graph complexity through heuristic pruning, accelerating path computation.  
- **Applicability:** Demonstrated applicability in high-performance 2D planar path planning, 3D aerial vehicle trajectory planning, and high-degree-of-freedom robotic arm trajectory planning.

*First-author paper scheduled for submission in Dec 2025.*

# Beyond Work {#beyond}
In my spare time, I find peace playing the piano in the music room of the university library — always grateful to my younger self for never giving up on it. <br> 
I love watching shows of all kinds, from suspense and sci-fi dramas to sitcoms (my top picks in recent years are *Magpie Murders* and *Modern Family*). <br>
And btw, I’m also a big fan of horror movies! <br>

**I often tell myself, "We don't make right choices. We make choices and prove them right." I hope to carry a nomadic spirit within me, building my own tent wherever the life leads.**
